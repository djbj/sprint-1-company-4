# Company project: Build your company's homepage
For this sprint youâ€™re going to build a one-pager for your newly started company. As inspiration, we are going to look at the start page of a company we work closely with: [iZettle](https://www.izettle.com/se). If we look closely at their homepage, we can see that it contains all the parts a standard website is built on â€” A header with navigation, a "Hero" section, modules running down the page with images and text, and finally a footer. So after this sprint youâ€™ll be able to build about the majority of all web pages out there. Or, at least the front-end parts ðŸ˜ƒ

We want you to be creative with this task and really use the skills you have in your teams. Let the page reflect your company and try to sell your unique fusion.

At the end of this sprint youâ€™ll be showing off your brand new one-pages to the web team at iZettle.

## How to complete this project

We have invited Charlotte Andersson as a guest lecturer in agile and scrum. She will give you tools in how you best divide your work and work together in your teams. One of the challenges in this project is to learn how to work as a team. As a web developer this is something you do on a daily basis.

For the actual one-pager you should look at [iZettle](https://www.izettle.com/se) as inspiration and try to mimic the functionality as close as you can.

Components your one-pager should have:

### Responsive header
The menu should work on all screen sizes. It should have a logotype, navigational links and one dropdown.

### Hero background image
A large cover image in the hero section. 

### Three selling points
Responsive grid with three selling points containing icons and copy for each of them.

### Feature section
List your top features with an image, text and button for each of them. 

### Footer
A navigational footer with social media links.

### :runner: Stretch Goals

Done with the project? Here's some ideas for things to continue with:

1. Make the menu fixed at the top on scroll
2. Change the hero image to a video
3. Build a javascript carousel for your selling points
3. Pixel push until youâ€™re really happy with the design outcome
